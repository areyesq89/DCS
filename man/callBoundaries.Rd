\usage{
callBoundaries(B, h, w = 10, t = 2, parallel = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{FS experiment produced by \code{BorderScores}.}

\item{h}{Window half-width.}

\item{w}{Minimum boundary separation.}

\item{t}{Threshold local Z-score for candidate boundaries.}

\item{parallel}{Run in parallel? Must register parallel backend first.}
}
\value{
data.frame of candidate boundaries
}
\description{
Scans across each chromosome. Calculates the local mean and variance of the border
score within the window [focus-h,focus+h]. Identifies foci with a border score at least
\emph{t} standard deviations above the mean. If multiple foci are within distance w of 
one another, the representative focus with the greatest border score is retained.
